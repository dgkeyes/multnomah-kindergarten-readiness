## Map Interactive

### Approaches

```{r layout="l-screen"}


tm_basemap(leaflet::providers$CartoDB.Positron) +
     tm_shape(filter(approaches, Quartile == 1)) +
     tm_dots(col = dk_blue,
             group = "test",
             size = .1,
             alpha = 1,
             popup.vars = c("District", "label")) +
     tm_shape(filter(approaches, Quartile != 1)) +
     tm_dots(col = dk_blue,
             size = .05,
             popup.vars = c("District", "label"),
             alpha = 0.25)


```

### Literacy

```{r layout="l-screen"}

tm_basemap(leaflet::providers$CartoDB.Positron) +
     tm_shape(filter(literacy, Quartile == 1)) +
     tm_dots(col = dk_blue,
             size = .1,
             alpha = 1,

### Math

```{r layout="l-screen"}
